Rakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, 

to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the 

monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The 

other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into 

the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thin, but still vigorous old 

man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his 

guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried 

to kiss his hand, but the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But 

Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete 

manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.
